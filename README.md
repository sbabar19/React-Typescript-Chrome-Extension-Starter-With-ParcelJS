## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
A `dist` folder will be generated in the project directory. In chrome's extension section, choose the `Load unpacked` option and direct it to this `dist` folder. 

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the extension for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your unpacked extension is ready to be deployed!
